# Book Search Refactor

## Description

This is a refactor of a working Google Book Search API application to use GraphQL. The original application was built using React and a RESTful API on top of a Node.js/Express backend using a MongoDB database. Our task was to make the application more efficient with GraphQL and master GraphQL in the process. I wish I could say that I did master GraphQL, but at least, I have a better understanding of it in preparation for the next GraphQL project.

## Installation

There will be no user installation for this application. The completed refactor will be deployed to Heroku.

## Usage

Refactor running on Heroku at: https://gentle-fjord-95460.herokuapp.com/. There is no functional change to this application. Only the front-end connection to the backend was changed. The application just supports a signup and login as well as the ability to search for books and save books for later review. Books are saved by user id.

This challenge was a refactor of exisiting code for the Module 21 Challenge of the University of Richmond Coding Boot Camp starting February 2022. Only the REST APIs were swapped out for GraphQL.
